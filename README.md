### Why?

This project was created with the main purpose of covering some Favicon issues on [Bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden)/[bitwarden_rs](https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs):
- Bitwarden incorrectly assumes that domains serve their Favicons on the root-level (i.e. at `http(s)://<domain>/favicon.ico`):
    - This behaviour is discouraged by [W3C's Technical Architecture Group](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/) (issue: [siteData-36](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html?type=1#siteData-36));
    - `<link rel="icon">` elements seem to be ignored, which means that websites that use non-root locations [won't have an icon](https://github.com/bitwarden/browser/issues/675) loaded by Bitwarden (e.g. [Uphold](https://uphold.com/), which hosts its favicon under [/img/favicon.ico](https://uphold.com/img/favicon.ico));
- Having custom icons for either reachable or non-reachable sites is currently not supported;
- There are [privacy concerns](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/website-icons/) regarding website icons:
   - When Bitwarden displays a login item associated with a website, it will issue requests to `icons.bitwarden.net`, leaking information on the websites you access **including private (intranet) hosts**.
  

### How does it work?

Upon load, `serve-favicons` scans the `icons/` folder for directories containing icon (`.ico`) files. These directories will be used internally as _"namespaces"_ and can have arbitrary names as long as they are valid DNS subdomain names, as specified in [RFC1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) â€” as a rule of thumb, stick to concise lowercase alphanumeric characters.

Loaded icons will be served by a simple HTTP server on port `8080` by default, which can be retrieved by querying either:
- `http://<icon>.<domain>:<port>`
- `http://<icon>@<host>:<port>` 

Where:
- "`<icon>`" is the resource name, e.g. "`github`" for the GitHub icon;
- "`<domain>`" is a configured URL domain/subdomain when loaded behind a reverse proxy, e.g. "`icons.example.com`" (more on this under the [configurations](#Configurations) section, below);
- "`<host>`" is the server's bound host or IP address, e.g. "`localhost`" or "`127.0.0.1`";
- "`<port>`" is the server's listening port (or an external port, for proxied requests).

Requests to either the root (`/`) or the favicon (`/favicon.ico`) URL path will be answered with a `200` HTTP response with `image/x-icon` content type for matching icons, or a `404` for missing ones.

If desired (e.g. for icons with multiple variants), it is also possible to query for icons under a specific namespace, with either:
- `http://<icon>.<namespace><domain>:<port>`
- `http://<icon>:<namespace>@<host>:<port>` 

### Integrating with Bitwarden

In order to use `serve-favicons` with Bitwarden, you'll need to [run](#Running) the server behind a reverse proxy (ideally with HTTPS) on a publicly accessible domain address. DNS resolution should also be configured so that queries for subdomains resolve to the same host.

Let's assume our domain is `my-super-domain.com` and that we want to use `icons.my-super-domain.com` as a public entrypoint to `serve-favicons`. Example DNS configuration on Cloudflare:

![DNS](docs/img/dns_example.jpg)

> ðŸ’¡ To test that our deployment is working, check with:
> ```bash
> $ curl -sLw "%{http_code}\\n" https://rss.icons.my-super-domain.com -o /dev/null
> # should print "200" if OK
> ```

Bitwarden only loads the icon for the first domain, so the _trick_ here is to use our server as **the first URL in the list** and mark it so that it never matches the domain for password detection:

![editing Bitwarden](docs/img/editing_example.jpg)

By saving this entry, we can confirm that the icon is loaded from `serve-favicons`:

![successful](docs/img/saved_example.jpg)

Now, simply repeat the above step for the remaining entries you wish to tweak, by adding a reference to an existing icon as the first URI and setting match detection to "Never".

## Running

### Configurations

On boot, the following default configuration will be used:
```json
{ 
  "domain": "icons.local",
  "port": 8080,
  "icons": {
    "basedir": "icons",
  },
}
```

Field | Description | Default value 
------|-------------|---------------
`domain` | domain to be used to match subdomain-based queries (e.g. "`icons.my-super-domain.com`", from [Integrating with Bitwarden](#Integrating-with-Bitwarden) above) | `icons.local` 
`port` | server listening port | `8080`
`icons.basedir` | location of the root icons directory (will default to the provided icons bundle, next to `server.js`) | `icons`

These defaults can be overridden by an external `config.json` file, whose path can be set via the `ICONS_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable â€” see [sample/config.json](sample/config.json) for an example of what could be loaded with "`ICONS_CONFIG_DIR=sample`".

By default, `DEBUG` logs will be disabled. If you wish to turn on these logs, set the `ICONS_DEBUG_MODE` environment variable to something truthy (e.g. `"true"`, or `1`).

## Credits
### Icons source

Most icons were based on the excellent work from [aegis-icons](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons) and converted to `.ico` using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)'s `mogrify` command:
```bash
mogrify -quiet -format ico -density 256x256 -background none -define icon:auto-resize=256 -path output icons/*.png
```
